## Multiplying Vectors

### 개념 요약

- The product of a scalar $s$ and a vector $\mathbf{v}$ is a new vector whose magnitude is $sv$ and whose direction is the same as that of $\mathbf{v}$ if $s$ is positive, and opposite that of $\mathbf{v}$ if $s$ is negative. To divide $\mathbf{v}$ by $s$, multiply $\mathbf{v}$ by $\frac{1}{s}$.

- The scalar (or dot) product of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is written $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$ and is the scalar quantity given by

$$\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = ab \cos \phi,$$

in which $\phi$ is the angle between the directions of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a}$. A scalar product is the product of the magnitude of one vector and the scalar component of the second vector along the direction of the first vector. In unit-vector notation,

$$\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = (a_x \hat{i} + a_y \hat{j} + a_z \hat{z}) \cdot (b_x \hat{i} + b_y \hat{j} + b_z \hat{z}),$$

which may be expanded according to the distributive law. Note that $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a}$.

- The vector (or cross) product of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is written $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ and is a vector $\mathbf{c}$ whose magnitude $c$ is given by

$$c = ab \sin \phi,$$

in which $\phi$ is the smaller of the angles between the directions of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. The direction of $\mathbf{c}$ is perpendicular to the plane defined by $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ and is given by a right-hand rule. Note that $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = −(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a})$. In unit-vector notation,

$$\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = (a_x \hat{i} + a_y \hat{j} + a_z \hat{k}) \times (b_x \hat{i} + b_y \hat{j} + b_z \hat{k}),$$

which we may expand with the distributive law.

- In nested products, where one product is buried inside another, follow the normal algebraic procedure by starting with the innermost product and working outward.
