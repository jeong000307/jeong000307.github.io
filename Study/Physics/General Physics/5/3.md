## Applying Newton’s Laws

### 개념 요약

- The net force $\mathbf{F}_\text{net}$ on a body with mass $m$ is related to the body’s acceleration $\mathbf{a}$ by

    $$\mathbf{F}_\text{net} = m \mathbf{a},$$

    which may be written in the component versions

    $$F_\text{net,x} = ma_x \quad F_\text{net,y} = ma_y \quad \text{and} \quad F_\text{net,z} = ma_z.$$

- If a force $$\mathbf{F}_{BC}$$ acts on body $B$ due to body $C$, then there is a force $$\mathbf{F}_{CB}$$ on body $C$ due to body $B$:

    $$\mathbf{F}_{BC} = \mathbf{F}_{CB}.$$

    The forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in directions.
