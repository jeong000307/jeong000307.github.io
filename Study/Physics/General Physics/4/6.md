## Relative Motion in One Dimension

### 개념 요약

- When two frames of reference $A$ and $B$ are moving relative to each other at constant velocity, the velocity
of a particle $P$ as measured by an observer in frame $A$ usually differs from that measured from frame $B$. The two measured velocities are related by

$$\mathbf{v}_{PA} = \mathbf{v}_{PB} + \mathbf{v}_{BA},$$

where $\mathbf{v}_\text{BA}$ is the velocity of $B$ with respect to $A$. Both observers measure the same acceleration for the particle :

$$\mathbf{a}_{PA} = \mathbf{a}_{PB}.$$

### 예제

### 연습 문제

> #### 1. A cameraman on a pickup truck is traveling westward at $20 \text{ km}/\text{h}$ while he records a cheetah that is moving westward $30 \text{ km}/\text{h}$ faster than the truck. Suddenly, the cheetah stops, turns, and then runs at $45 \text{ km}/\text{h}$ eastward, as measured by a suddenly nervous crew member who stands alongside the cheetah’s path. The change in the animal’s velocity takes $2.0 \text{ s}$. What are the (a) magnitude and (b) direction of the animal’s acceleration according to the cameraman and the (c) magnitude and (d) direction according to the nervous crew member?
