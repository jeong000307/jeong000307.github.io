## Unit Vectors, Adding Vectors by Components

### 개념 요약

- Unit vectors $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$ have magnitudes of unity and are directed in the positive directions of the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively, in a right-handed coordinate system. We can write a vector $\mathbf{a}$ in terms of unit vectors as

$$\mathbf{a} = a_x \hat{i} + a_y \hat{j} + a_z \hat{k},$$

in which $a_x \hat{i}$, $a_y \hat{j}$, and $a_z \hat{k}$ are the vector components of $\mathbf{a}$ and $a_x$, $a_y$, and $a_z$ are its scalar components.

- To add vectors in component form, we use the rules

$$r_x = a_x + b_x \quad r_y = a_y + b_y \quad r_z = a_z + b_z.$$

Here $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are the vectors to be added, and $\mathbf{r}$ is the vector sum. Note that we add components axis by axis.
