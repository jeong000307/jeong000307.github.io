## Vectors And Their Components

### 개념 요약

- Scalars, such as temperature, have magnitude only. They are specified by a number with a unit (10°C) and obey the rules of arithmetic and ordinary algebra. Vectors, such as displacement, have both magnitude and direction (5 m, north) and obey the rules of vector algebra.

- Two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ may be added geometrically by drawing them to a common scale and placing them head to tail. The vector connecting the tail of the first to the head of the second is the vector sum $\mathbf{s}$. To subtract $\mathbf{b}$ from $\mathbf{a}$, reverse the direction of $\mathbf{b}$ to get $-\mathbf{b}$; then add $‒\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{a}$. Vector addition is commutative and obeys the associative law.

- The (scalar) components $a_x$ and $a_y$ of any two-dimensional vector $\mathbf{a}$ along the coordinate axes are found by dropping perpendicular lines from the ends of $\mathbf{a}$ onto the coordinate axes. The components are given by

$$a_x = a \cos \theta, \qquad a_y = a \sin \theta,$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the positive direction of the $x$ axis and the direction of $\mathbf{a}$. The algebraic sign of a component indicates its direction along the associated axis. Given its components, we can find the magnitude and orientation of the vector $\mathbf{a}$ with

$$a = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2}, \qquad \tan \theta = \frac{a_y}{a_x}.$$

- 벡터
    + 크기와 방향을 갖고 있는 양, 예시로는 변위 등이 있다.

- 스칼라
    + 크기만 갖고 있는 양, 예시로는 온도 등이 있다.

- 벡터의 요소
    + 2차원 벡터 $\mathbb{a}$가 있다고 하자. 그러면 $a_x = \lvert \mathbb{a} \rvert \cos \theta$이고, $a_y = \lvert \mathbb{a} \rvert \sin \theta$이다.
    + 벡터 $\mathbb{a}$의 크기 $\lvert \mathbb{a} \rvert$는 $\sqrt{(a_x)^2 + (a_y)^2}$이고, 벡터 $\mathbb{a}$와 $x$축 사이의 동경 $\theta$는 $\frac{a_y}{a_x}$이다.
