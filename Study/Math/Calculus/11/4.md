## The Comparison Tests

### 개념 요약

- 다음은 비교판정법에 대한 설명이다.

    > #### Theorem.
    >
    > Suppose that $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ are series with positive terms.
    >
    > If $\sum b_n$ is convergent and $a_n \le b_n$ for all $n$, then $\sum a_n$ is also convergent.
    >
    > If $\sum b_n$ is divergent and $a_n \ge b_n$ for all $n$, then $\sum a_n$ is also divergent.

    > $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = c$$
    >
    > where $c$ is finite number and $c \gt 0$, then either both series converge or both diverge.
