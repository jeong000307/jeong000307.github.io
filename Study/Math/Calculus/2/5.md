## Continuity

### 개념 요약

- A function $f$ is continuous at a number $a$ if

    $$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$$

- A function $f$ is continuous from the right at a number $a$ if

    $$\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a)$$

    and $f$ is continuous from the left at a number $a$ if

    $$\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = f(a)$$

- A function $f$ is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every number in the interval. (If $f$ is defined only on one side of an endpoint of the interval, we understand continuous at the endpoint to mean continuous from the right or continuous from the left.)

- If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $a$ and $c$ is a constant, then the following functions are also continuous at $a$:

    $$ f + g, \quad f - g, \quad cf, \quad fg, \quad \frac{f}{g} \ \text{ if } g(a) \ne 0$$

- The following types of functions are continuous at every number in their domains:

    polynomials, rational functions, root functions, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions

- If $f$ is continuous at $b$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = b$, then $\lim_{x \to a} f(g(x)) = f(b)$. In other words,

    $$\lim_{x \to a} f(g(x)) = f \left( \lim_{x \to a} g(x) \right)$$

- If $g$ is continuous at $a$ and $f$ is continuous at $g(a)$, then the composite function $f \circ g$ given by $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$ is continuous at $a$.

- (The Intermediate Value Theorem) Suppose that $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and let $N$ be any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, where $f(a) \ne f(b)$. Then there exists a number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f(c) = N$.
