## The Derivative as a Function

### 개념 요약

- $$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$

- A function $f$ is differentiable at $a$ if $f'(a)$ exists. It is differentiable on an open interval $(a, b)$ [or $(a, \infty)$ or $(-\infty, a)$ or $(-\infty, \infty)$] if it is differentiable at every number in the interval.

- If $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f$ is continuous at $a$.
    + Note that converse of this theorem is false; that is, there are functions that are continuous but not differentiable. For instance, the function $f(x) = \lvert x \rvert$ is continuous at $0$ but $f$ is not differentiable at $0$.
