## Derivatives and Rates of Change

### 개념 요약

- The tangent line to the curve $y = f(x)$ at the point $P(a, f(a))$ is the line through $P$ with slope

    $$m = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$$

    provided that this limit exists.

- The derivative of a function $f$ at a number $a$, denoted by $f'(a)$, is

    $$f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$$

    if this limit exists.

- The tangent line to $y = f(x)$ at $(a, f(a))$ is the line through $(a, f(a))$ whose slope is equal to $f'(a)$, the derivative of $f$ at $a$.

- $$\text{instantaneous rate of change} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \lim_{x_2 \to x_1} \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}$$

- The derivative $f'(a)$ is the instantaneous rate of change of $y = f(x)$ with respect to $x$ when $x = a$.
