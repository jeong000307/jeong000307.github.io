## Vector Spaces

### 개념 정리

- A vector space (or linear space) $\mathsf{V}$ over a field $F$ consists of a set on which two operations (called addition and scalar multiplication, respectively) are defined so that for each pair of elements $x$, $y$, in $\mathsf{V}$ there is a unique element $x + y$ in $\mathsf{V}$, and for each element a in $F$ and each element $x$ in $\mathsf{V}$ there is a unique element $ax$ in $\mathsf{V}$, such that the following conditions hold.
    + (VS 1) For all $x$, $y$ in $\mathsf{V}$, $x + y = y + x$ (commutativity of addition).
    + (VS 2) For all $x$, $y$, $z$ in $\mathsf{V}$, $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$ (associativity of addition).
    + (VS 3) There exists an element in $\mathsf{V}$ denoted by 0 such that $x + 0 = x$ for each $x$ in $\mathsf{V}$.
    + (VS 4) For each element $x$ in $\mathsf{V}$ there exists an element $y$ in $\mathsf{V}$ such that $x + y = 0$.
    + (VS 5) For each element $x$ in $\mathsf{V}$, $1x = x$.
    + (VS 6) For each pair of elements $a$, $b$ in $F$ and each element $x$ in $\mathsf{V}$, $(ab)x = a(bx)$.
    + (VS 7) For each element $a$ in $F$ and each pair of elements $x$, $y$ in $\mathsf{V}$, $a(x + y) = ax + ay$.
    + (VS 8) For each pair of elements $a$, $b$ in $F$ and each element $x$ in $\mathsf{V}$, $(a + b)x = ax + bx$.

- An object of the form $(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n)$, where the entries $a_1$, $a_2$, $\cdots$, $a_n$ are elements of a field $F$, is called an $n$-tuple with entries from $F$. The elements $a_1$, $a_2$, $\cdots$, $a_n$ are called the entries or components of the $n$-tuple. Two $n$-tuples $(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n)$ and $(b_1, b_2, \cdots, b_n)$ with entries from a field $F$ are called equal if $a_i = b_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \cdots, n$.
