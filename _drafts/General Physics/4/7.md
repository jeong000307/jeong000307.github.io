## Relative Motion in Two Dimensions

### 개념 요약

- When two frames of reference $A$ and $B$ are moving relative to each other at constant velocity, the velocity
of a particle $P$ as measured by an observer in frame $A$ usually differs from that measured from frame $B$. The two measured velocities are related by

$$\mathbf{v}_{PA} = \mathbf{v}_{PB} + \mathbf{v}_{BA},$$

where $\mathbf{v}_\text{BA}$ is the velocity of $B$ with respect to $A$. Both observers measure the same acceleration for the particle:

$$\mathbf{a}_{PA} = \mathbf{a}_{PB}.$$
